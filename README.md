# Responsive-Portfolio
Updated Portfolio using Bootstrap CSS

This is my porfolio of past and ongoing web development projects, retooled from the previous version using
Bootstrap CSS. It is intended to be responsive and formatted for all screen sizes. The site contains an about me page, a contact page, and a portfolio gallery page. It will be updated continually with any new projects or information.
